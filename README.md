## Real-time todo App
I created a full stack todo app with a real-time collaberation between users using TypeScript with Nextjs, Node and Firebase.

## Running the App
After cloning the app you will need a .env file containing the following:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID=
```
You will also need a firebase admin sdk json file by generating it following the guide on this link:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app
to run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
